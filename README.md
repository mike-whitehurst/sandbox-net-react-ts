## About
This is a sandbox project for playing with .NET React TypeScript Vite.

## Initial setup notes
1. vite couldn't create a certificate - required config to create a folder
2. npm couldn't find node - had to show available versions and pick one, don't know why visual studio defaulted to an invalid version
